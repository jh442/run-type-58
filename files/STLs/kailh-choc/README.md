## Kailh Choc 3D printed keycaps

I took a stab at making my own 3D printed keycaps for Kailh Choc style switches

Printer used: Ender 3 at 0.12mm quality
PLA: Matte PLA

On some of the keys, I got creative with adding a "pause at layer" script to swap filament colors.

I also was testing the idea of the escape key being labelled.

Note: My custom PCB design required me two issues due to mistakes on my part.

1. I had to make 1.3U switches for my enter/space keys for a better fit with my case
2. I had to make 2 orientations of the 1.3U switch (horizontal and vertical) because I incorrectly oriented the sockets in my PCB design on the left board. Good thing I designed these!
